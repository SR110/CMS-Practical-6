This week we were assigned to form and finalize grouping for the remaining assessments in CP3402 - Content Management Systems. When we were first asked to group up, everyone present quickly approached those whom they were comfortable working with. Since I was not that close to anyone, I chose to group up with those people, who were not part of any group, as a last resort. Realising soon that I would not be given a choice in a work setting, I was relieved that I would be practising to work in an office setting, in which we do not have the liberty to pick and choose the people whom we will be working alongside.   

In a Practical Session following that, I switched to another group as the group only had 3 members, instead of four and I was also familiar with their working styles. This decision to switch can be considered both good and bad. The good part being that I was now, in an environment, in which I knew more people and their working styles, rather than in an environment where I was forced to work with random people, with no knowledge whatsoever about how their attitudes are and how their working styles might be.   

The bad side of this decision is that I did not try to work in an environment that would have trained me to adjust to a work setting.
