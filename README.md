# Learning Activities & Resources
This week we were assigned to form and finalize grouping for the remaining assessments in CP3402 - Content Management Systems. When we were first asked to group up, everyone present quickly approached those whom they were comfortable working with. Since I was not that close to anyone, I chose to group up with those people, who were not part of any group, as a last resort. Realising soon that I would not be given a choice in a work setting, I was relieved that I would be practising to work in an office setting, in which we do not have the liberty to pick and choose the people whom we will be working alongside.   

In a Practical Session following that, I switched to another group as the group only had 3 members, instead of four and I was also familiar with their working styles. This decision to switch can be considered both good and bad. The good part being that I was now, in an environment, in which I knew more people and their working styles somewhat better, rather than in an environment where I was forced to work with random people, with no knowledge whatsoever about how their attitudes are and how their working styles might be.   

The bad side of this decision is that I did not try to work in an environment that would have trained me to adjust to a work setting. However, I think I will eventually be forced to be in such a setting in the future (when I work) and will get accustomed to my team and the members' working styles.

# Estimated Hours
I spent about 7 hours on the Practical for Week 6, watching the videos shown by Prof and also doing 2 courses from LinkedIn Learning. I spent around 4 hours on the LinkedIn Learning Courses and 3 hours rewatching the videos shown in class.

# Content Insights
I firstly learnt about the different platforms like Trello, GitHub and Slack - applications that are essential for the IT industry. Then, I revisited Daily Stand-ups, about how they should be done standing up and be short and crisp, giving everyone an equal opportunity to speak and raise concerns about any pressing issues that they are facing. This week, we also learnt about how we can connect remotely with team members and still get the work done effectively.

LinkedIn Courses - 
1. Teamwork Essentials: Stand Out as a Valuable Team Member by Shad√© Zahrai
This course talks about strengthening one's reputation and improving other skills required for a good team member. She also explains how one can resolve conflicts, engage collaboratively and create a safe environment for discussion.

2. Slack Essential Training by Gini von Courter
This course teaches how to navigate through the portal, by creating a customised profile and engaging in conversations. She also talks about how to upload, share and comment on files. She also mentions how to search for content, work with channels, and add apps.

I must admit that I learnt a lot this week from these videos and courses.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
By forming teams and gearing up for the remaining assessments, I will be much better equipped with the necessary skills to work with people who I know, but do not know about their working styles as much. Since I changed my group to a different one later on into the module, I did not get a chance to get to know the new members well. Still, I intend to spend some time understanding each person's strong and weak points and using these points to the advantage of the entire group and also to do the tasks assigned well.

Other than knowing my team members, I also completed 2 LinkedIn Learning Courses, one on being a valuable team member and the second on learning about the platform slack. Both these courses give me an edge and improve my soft skills as well as virtual communication skills. These skills equip me with knowledge required in the IT sector and they will definitely help a great deal in the future.
